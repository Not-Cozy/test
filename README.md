# Cozy's Presentation
Heya I'm Cozy, I am new to Github and coding as well. I hope I enjoy my stay in here and also I wish I can get good relationships with the community in here.
I'm trying to be more positive (I'm rude sometimes,for some people.) so I'm trying to change that at the same time I learn how to code. I will, or will not, make friends in here while I start my journey and continue it,
That's all.

Cozy..
